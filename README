static security scanner to discover vulnerabilities in the source code.

I. Test this Plugin
The best way to test if this plugin is correctly installed in Findbugs is to scan Webgoat (http://superb-dca3.dl.sourceforge.net/project/owasp/WebGoat/WebGoat%205.2/WebGoat-5.2.war)
After the scan, check the output: Under security, there should be two Non-standard Cipher Instance bugs

II. Add New Detectors
1. Create a new class that extends com.spec.sca.BaseDetector:
-Detectors are implemented as template pattern
-BaseDetctor is the base class for any concrete Detector to extends
-Implement all abstract getters and setters 
-Implement verifyTarget() that is the method of detector to detect bugs
-Use accumulateBug(bug, methodGen, javaClass, location) to add a detected bug in verifyTarget() method 
2. Add a new "class" node in class-bugs.xml file
3. Run com.spec.sca.util.ConfigConverter
